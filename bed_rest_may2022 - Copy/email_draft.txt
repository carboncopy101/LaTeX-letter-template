Hello sir Peter!

I would like to request to work from home during the period of May 5-13, 2022.
I had a tumor removed on my left foot last April 25, 2022.
During my checkup a few days ago, my doctor advised me to undergo 15 days of bed rest since he is not yet confident my wound will hold without sutures.
I have a follow up appointment on May 16, 2022, hopefully by then my sutures will be removed. 

Attached in this email is a letter detailing my situation and a medical certificate from the UP Health Service.
The letter also details my task for the two weeks that I'll be working from home.
All the tasks planned does not need me to report onsite.

Thank you!
-Carlo Carino
