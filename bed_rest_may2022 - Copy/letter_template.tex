\opening{Dear Sir:}

%ask permission to work from home may 5-13
I would like to request for your permission to work from home during the period of May 5 - 13, 2022.

%explain situtation
Last April 25, 2022 I had a tumor removed in my left foot.
A week after, May 2, 2022, my doctor advised me to get some bed rest since he is not yet confident that it is safe to remove my sutures. 
The doctor recommended that I undergo 15 days of bed rest.
I have a follow-up appointment on May 16, 2022 to check the condition of my wound and hopefully, by then I'll have my sutures removed.

%task to do in that duration
I am working on implementing a compression algorithm using wavelet transform and finding another technique to complement my current progress with using  singular value decomposition and fast fourier transform for image compression.
The algorithms will be tested and compared by checking the error and the final image size with respect to compression ratio. For the transceiver side of the project, I am still writing the functions on implementing cylic redundancy checks to check for data corruption during transmission. I have reviewed the algorithm and now I need to write the code.  The said tasks are done with a computer and will not need me reporting onsite.

I have attached the medical certificate issued to me by the UP Health Service in the next pages. Also, I have informed my supervisor and the senior SRS in the project about my situation and my tasks to do during this period.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
\\
\closing{Regards,}
