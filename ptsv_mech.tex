\opening{Dear Engr. Peter Antonio B. Banzo}

I am writing to express my intent to apply for the Project Technical Specialist V position specializing in the robotics and mechanical part of the ROAMER FASTRAC Lite project.  

I am part of the original ROAMER project where I assumed a Science Research Specialist
II role then a Project Technical Specialist I from 2021 until present. My contribution to the
project is on the development of the wireless teleoperation and telemetry of the developed robot and its system. The opportunity to work on this project gave me a thorough understanding of the robot developed as well as the other technical aspects of the project outside of my role. 

Thank you for considering my application for the position.
Together with this letter are the application requirements. Please donâ€™t hesitate to send me an
email if you have any questions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
\\
\closing{Regards,}
